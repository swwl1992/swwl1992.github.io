<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h3>Ocaml type system</h3>

<p>The ML languages are statically and strictly typed.
In addition, every expression has exactly one type.
In contrast, C is a weakly-typed language:
values of one type can usually coerced to a value of any other type,
whether the coercion makes sense or not.</p>

<p>What is &quot;safety&quot;?
There is a formal definition based on the operational semantics of
the programming language,
but an approximte definition is that a valid program will never fault
because of an invalid machine operation.
All memory access will be valid.
ML guarantees safety by proving that every program that
passes the type checker can never produce a machine fault.
Another functional language,
Lisp which is dynamically and strictly typed,
guarantees its safety by checking for validity at run time.
One of the consequences is that ML has no <code>nil</code> or <code>NULL</code> values.
These values would potentially cause mechine errors if used
where a value is expected.</p>

<p>An Ocaml programmer may initially spend a lot of time getting the Ocaml
type checker to accept his programs.
But eventually
he will find the type checker is one of his best friends.
It helps a programmer figure out
where errors may be lurking in programs.
If a change is made, the type checker will track down the parts that
are affected.
At the meantime,
here are some rules about type checking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every expression has exactly one type.</li>
<li>When an expression is evaluated, one of the four things may happen:

<ul>
<li>it may evaluate to a <code>value</code> of the same type as the expression,</li>
<li>it may raise an exception,</li>
<li>it may not terminate,</li>
<li>it may exit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the important points in Ocaml is that
there are no &quot;pure commands&quot;.
Every assignment produce a value
- although the value has the trivial <code>unit</code> type.
Below let us see some examples of how Ocaml type system works:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ocaml"><span class="lineno">1</span>   <span class="k">if</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="k">then</span>
<span class="lineno">2</span>       <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="lineno">3</span>   <span class="k">else</span>
<span class="lineno">4</span>       <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">3</span>
</code></pre></div>
